ServiceNow Change Request – Avocent MP1000 / ACS Firmware Upgrade
1. Change Type

Normal Change (with implementation plan, test plan, and backout plan)

2. Summary / Short Description

Upgrade firmware on Avocent MP1000 / ACS 8000 appliances to the latest vendor-supported version and apply associated security vulnerability fixes.

3. Business Justification

The Avocent MP1000 / ACS appliances provide remote console access, OOB management, and power control for critical infrastructure.

Current firmware is outdated and contains known security vulnerabilities identified by the Security Team.

The upgrade ensures:

Closure of identified vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated OpenSSL libraries, SSH hardening updates, CVE fixes, etc.).

Compliance with corporate security baseline and audit requirements.

Continued vendor support for ACS appliances.

This change is essential for maintaining secure remote access and reducing operational risk to datacenter infrastructure.

4. Devices in Scope

Primary Node: MP1000 / ACS 8000 – Location: Ashburn

Secondary Node: MP1000 / ACS 8000 – Location: Hillsboro

Both configured in High Availability (HA)

(Modify device names, IPs, or counts as needed)

5. Current Firmware Version

MP1000 / ACS: <current version here>

Latest available version from Vertiv: <target version here>

6. Change Description

Download the latest firmware from Vertiv support portal.

Upgrade both primary and secondary ACS/MP1000 appliances to the latest stable release.

Apply vendor recommended vulnerability patches included in the firmware package.

Validate successful upgrade and establish full HA synchronization.

Confirm accessibility through console session, SSH, and DSView (if applicable).

7. Implementation / Execution Plan

Step-by-step upgrade workflow:

Notify stakeholders and NOC before starting.

Backup current configuration from both ACS appliances.

Verify HA status (Primary active, Secondary standby).

Upload firmware image to the Secondary node.

Initiate upgrade on Secondary appliance first.

Reboot and validate that the Secondary is healthy and rejoined HA cluster.

Upload firmware to Primary appliance.

Initiate upgrade on Primary appliance.

Reboot primary and validate HA sync.

Validate:

Console port sessions

Network reachability

SNMP monitoring

Syslog/AAA integration

DSView connectivity (if used)

Turn the system back over to operations with post-upgrade confirmation.

8. Expected Impact

Minimal impact due to HA configuration.

During each node upgrade, the system will fail over automatically.

Console access should remain available throughout.

No impact expected to production workloads relying on the servers behind these terminal servers.

9. Risk Assessment

Low to Medium risk
Risks include:

Firmware upgrade failure

HA sync failures

Console port disruption if both nodes experience unexpected reboot

Configuration corruption (mitigated by backups)

Risk mitigation:

Perform upgrade on Secondary first

Full configuration backup

Vendor support available

Scheduled during maintenance window

10. Backout / Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

Reboot appliance back into previous firmware (if supported by dual-image feature).

Restore configuration from backup.

Failback to stable node if HA is impacted.

If both nodes fail, restore using Vertiv USB recovery image.

Contact Vertiv support for emergency assistance if needed.

Rollback estimated time: 30–45 minutes

11. Testing / Validation Steps

Post-upgrade, verify:

HA status = “Healthy / Synchronized”

All console ports are accessible

SSH login works

SNMP RO community works (if configured)

Syslog messages being sent to log collectors

DSView 4 Hub/Spoke connectivity (if applicable)

All monitored services green in NOC dashboard

Obtain confirmation from NOC/Operations.

12. Communication Plan

Notify: NOC, Server Team, Networking Team, Security Team

Announcement 30 minutes prior to beginning change

Notify again upon completion and validation

13. Implementation Window

<Insert preferred date and time>

Recommended: Low-usage maintenance window, typically weekend or late-evening.

Estimated duration: 60–90 minutes

14. Pre-Requisites

Confirm access to:

Web GUI

SSH

DSView (if applicable)

Confirm backup path and config export

Confirm HA is stable

Download firmware ahead of time

Verify no critical maintenance or DR activity occurring simultaneously

15. Approvals Required

Server/Infra Manager

Security Team

Networking

Datacenter Operations
