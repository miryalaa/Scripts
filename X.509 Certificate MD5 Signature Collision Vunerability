The Qualys finding "X.509 certificate MD5 signature collision vulnerability" means the Windows Server (IIS, RDP, LDAP/LDAPS, SQL, etc.) is presenting a certificate signed with the MD5 hashing algorithm.

ðŸ”Ž Why itâ€™s flagged

MD5 is cryptographically broken (prone to collision attacks).

Attackers can forge a certificate that looks valid to clients.

Modern browsers and clients no longer trust MD5-signed certificates.

âœ… How to Fix on Windows Servers

Identify the Affected Certificate

Open MMC â†’ Certificates (Computer Account)
Navigate to:
Certificates â†’ Personal â†’ Certificates

Look for the certificate bound to the affected service (IIS, RDP, LDAPS, etc.).

Check its signature algorithm â†’ should say md5RSA.

Or via PowerShell:

Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My | 
Select-Object Subject, Thumbprint, SignatureAlgorithm, NotAfter


Request a New Certificate (with SHA-256 or stronger)

If using an internal CA (AD CS):

Request with SHA-256:

certreq -new request.inf request.req


Ensure CA templates are configured to issue SHA-256 by default.

If using a public CA:

Reissue the certificate with SHA-256 (most CAs default to SHA-256 today).

Replace the Old Certificate

For IIS:

Open IIS Manager â†’ Select site â†’ Bindings â†’ Edit HTTPS binding â†’ choose the new cert.

For RDP:

Group Policy:
Computer Configuration â†’ Administrative Templates â†’ Windows Components â†’ Remote Desktop Services â†’ Remote Desktop Session Host â†’ Security â†’ Server authentication certificate template

For LDAP/LDAPS:

Install the new cert in LocalMachine\My and restart Active Directory Domain Services.

For SQL Server:

Update certificate in SQL Server Configuration Manager â†’ SQL Server Network Configuration â†’ Protocols for <Instance> â†’ Properties â†’ Certificate tab.

Remove the MD5-Signed Certificate

Once the service is bound to the new SHA-256 cert, delete the old one:

Remove-Item -Path Cert:\LocalMachine\My\<Thumbprint>


Restart Services

IIS: iisreset

RDP: Restart service or reboot

AD DS / SQL: Restart respective service

ðŸ”’ Verification

Re-run a Qualys scan after replacement.

Or manually check:

Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My | 
Select-Object Subject, SignatureAlgorithm


Ensure algorithm is sha256RSA (or stronger).
