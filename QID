üõ†Ô∏è Remediation Approach

Attempted Fix:

Installed CA-signed certificate with valid SAN and FQDN entries.

Restarted MP1000 services and verified via Qualys re-scan ‚Äî issue persists.

Vendor Limitation:

The application continues to use its self-signed certificate for internal communication on port 3871.

Vendor confirms no configuration method or patch currently available to replace or bind the service with an external CA-signed certificate.

Next Steps (Mitigation Plan):

File a Request for Action (RA) or Engineering Request with Vertiv DSView/MP1000 product team.

Track vendor response for future firmware updates or hotfixes that allow certificate replacement.

Restrict port 3871 access to trusted internal subnets only using firewall rules or ACLs.

Ensure secure external communication channels (e.g., HTTPS on other ports with valid certs) are maintained with CA-signed certificates.

‚öñÔ∏è Risk Treatment Option

Since the vendor confirmed no remediation is possible at this time, choose:

‚û°Ô∏è Risk Treatment: Risk Acceptance (with Compensating Controls)

Justification:

The service is restricted to internal network access (not publicly exposed).

The vulnerability does not affect authentication or encryption strength, only certificate trust origin.

Vendor acknowledgment and escalation confirm this is a known product design limitation.

Monitoring and compensating controls (network isolation, limited access, and TLS enforcement) minimize exploitation risk.

‚úÖ Risk Acceptance Statement

The ‚ÄúSSL Certificate - Self-Signed Certificate‚Äù vulnerability (Qualys QID 38169) detected on Vertiv MP1000 v3.80.3, port 3871, cannot be remediated due to vendor limitations. Vertiv has confirmed that the application continues to use a self-signed SSL certificate internally, even after replacement with a CA-signed certificate.

As the affected service is only accessible from internal management networks, and the risk of exploitation is minimal, this finding will be formally accepted until the vendor releases a software update enabling replacement of the certificate.

Compensating controls include:

Restricting port 3871 to internal/trusted systems via network ACLs.

Regular vulnerability scans to track status.

Following up with vendor for a patch or configuration update.
